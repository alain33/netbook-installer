# NetbookInstaller #
NetbookInstaller is a utility used on netbooks already running Mac OS X Snow Leopard. It is used to apply the latest machine patches to your netbook. These might include kernel extensions (such as drivers), DSDT patches, or just OS X configuration settings. NetbookInstaller is also used to prepare a USB drive so that it can be used to install Mac OS X Snow leopard on machines, specifically netbooks, that are unsupported by Apple.
